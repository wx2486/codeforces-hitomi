codeforces-hitomi
=================

Pull data from codeforces api and produce useful analysis. Even a website with most cf functions, if I have time.

Now some data is accessable from a mysql server:

see https://www.dropbox.com/s/z6hwlo9qr444btn/ip.txt

port: 3306

username: hitomi

password: sharingan

Warning: there are some problems with my dropbox now, so the ip.txt may be out of date.
I'm trying to fix this.
