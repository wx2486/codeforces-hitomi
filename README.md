codeforces-hitomi
=================

Pull data from codeforces api and produce useful analysis. Even a website with most cf functions, if I have time.

hitomi 0.01 released. Written in python. We can use it to move data from cf to file/mysql or from file to mysql. Try it now!

Now some data is accessable from a mysql server:

// codeforces submission data is too large, my laptop is not capable. So, from now on, I will put a small part of
it into mysql, if not none of them......

//ip see https://github.com/wx2486/ip_address/blob/master/ip.txt

(ip may change over time, when my adsl conncection refreshes.)
